# MLP-digit-classifier
Short project I made for Udacity Deep Learning with Pytorch course. 

This model uses a Multi-layer perceptron to classify images from the MNIST hand-written digit database. The perceptron contains two hidden layers of size 128 and 64. Achieved 97% (9783/10000) test accuracy in 10 epochs.
